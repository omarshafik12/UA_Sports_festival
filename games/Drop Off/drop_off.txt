Overview:
    - In this game Momo randomly drops items that Midoriya has to evade.

How to play:
    - You must avoid all items that Momo drops until the timer reaches zero
    - Every 30 seconds the interval between when Momo drops them shortens by a second

                                                        Coding & Logic
Momo.py:
    - initializes and runs drop_off_mechanics functions

drop_off_mechanics.py:
    - generate_items():
        - generate_items():
            - it rescales items to fit within 200 x 200 and then appends them as a possible choice in the list

        - creation_animation():
            - creates an animation for each time Momo "creates" an object.
        
        - Remaining functions have been discussed in Decay_Invaders.txt
        
        - difficulty_increase():
            - for every 30 seconds it lowers the second timer(is always 30 seconds lower as it is used by conditional) by 30 seconds and lowers the drop timer by 1 
                - at the last 30 seconds Momo should drop a item every second
            - Lastly if the timer is zero then the player wins the game.
