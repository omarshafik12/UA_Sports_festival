Overview:
    - This is meant to resemble the cookie game from squid game
    - The player has to cover most of the cookie's frame to move on to the next image

How to play:
    - Once you touch cookie the game starts
    - You can only move to the next cookie when there is a 10 to 1 ratio of midoriya drawing to black of the cookie
    - You have 3 seconds between each cookie switch to get back on the black line. 

                                                        Coding & Logic
Shota.py:
    - The function load new item, allows for the transition to new content to change levels in the game
    - The "waiting" mechanicisms allow for the user to set and be on the cookie before the check collision starts checking again
    - The for loop draws the lines and circles in the game_mechanics.lines list.
    - The rest of the code mainly runs the Ice_cutter_mechanics functions.

Ice_cutter_mechanics.py:    
    - Squid_game_mechanics():
        - __init__():
            - Initializes player aspects and key variables
            
        - Move_draw():
            - This function recalculates the inputs of the new x and y coordinates and aligns the object before blitting it onto the screen

        - Check_Collision():
            - The function uses pixel perfect collision with masks to decide between two booleans
            - Futhermore if True then it adds coordinates to a temporary list 
                - Once there is 2 sets of coordinates in that list so that the for loop in Shota is able to draw a line which needs to coordinates
        
        - grab_screen():
            - This function copies a subsection of the screen that contains mainly the cookie. Then it goes through every pixel and gets the colors count(black or Midoriya's light blue)
                - With this information it calculates the ratio and if the ratio is 10 to 1, Mid blue to cookie black, then the player can move on to the next level.
